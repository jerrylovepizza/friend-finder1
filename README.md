# Convert your survey results into a simple array of numbers (ex: [5, 1, 4, 4, 5, 1, 2, 5, 4, 1]).
With that done, compare the difference between your scores against those from other users, question by question. Add up the differences to calculate the totalDifference.
Example:
Your secores: [5, 1, 4, 4, 5, 1, 2, 5, 4, 1]
Another User: [3, 2, 6, 4, 5, 1, 2, 5, 4, 1]
Total Difference: 2 + 1 + 2 = 5
The closest match will be the user with the least amount of difference.
Once you've found the most compatible friend, the App will display the result as a modal pop-up.

The modal displays both the name and picture of the closest match.
